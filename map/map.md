# Array.map() is a method in JavaScript that allows you to create a new array by applying a function to each element in an existing array.

# syntax array.map(callbackFn);

# The map() method takes a callback function as its argument, which is executed once for each element in the array.

# The result of each call to the callback function is added to a new array, which is returned by the map() method.

# The original array is not mutated by the map() method.

# The map() method creates a new array that has the same length as the original array.

# The callbackFunction takes three arguments: the current element being processed, the index of the current element, and the array being processed.

# You can use Array.map() to perform various operations on an array, such as filtering, transforming, or flattening the data.

# Array.map() returns a new array, so you should assign the result to a variable to use it later.
