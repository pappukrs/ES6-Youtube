# An arrow function is a concise syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript.

# It was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) as a more concise and expressive way to define functions.

The syntax of an arrow function is as follows:

(parameter1, parameter2, â€¦, parameterN)=> {
// function body
}

# If the function body contains only a single expression, the curly braces and the return keyword can be omitted.
